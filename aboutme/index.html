    <h2>Evan Mason</h2>
    <p> Hello, I am Evan and I am originally from Southern California, when I was young we moved to Pennsylvania for a few years before heading back to California, but have been in Austin Texas for the last three years.  I have been married to my wife since 2016, and we have a two boys, three and one years old.  

    </p>I served my mission in Guatemala and loved my time there.  I have been a member my whole life and currently have a calling as an English Connect teacher.  I love to spend time on the water when possible.  In California it was the beach, here in Texas it's on the lake either paddle boarding, wakeboarding or tubing.  I also like motorcycles but sold my bike when I got married.
    <p></p>  I am interested in earning a degree in computer science and this class will help me with a few systems we use at work.  Along with this class I am taking an introduction to programming class.</p>
